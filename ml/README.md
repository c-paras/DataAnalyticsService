FILE SUMMARY
============

* `clustering.py`: perform clustering on the movie dataset, with given algorithm and number of clusters
* `run_clustering.sh`: script that runs all clustering algorithm combinations
* `cluster-numbers.pk`: serialized Python object containing a mapping of movie titles to cluster numbers
* `clusters.pk`: serialized Python object containing a mapping of cluster numbers to a list of movie titles and IDs
* `metrics.txt`: raw output of the metrics used while running the different clustering algorithms
* `metrics.csv`: csv of the metrics used while running the different clustering algorithms
* `metrics.xlsx`: spreadsheet of the metrics used while running the different clustering algorithms
* `scatter_chart.py`: plots the metrics for the clustering algorithms on an overlayed scatter plot for comparison
* `scatter_chart.png`: output scatter plot generated by the above script
* `recommend.py`: retrieve recommendations for a movie from the serialized cluster data
* `README.md`: this file

ALGORITHM CHOICE
================

* Based on the analysis, the best choice of parameters is the KMeans algorithm with 300 clusters.
* This gives a good midpoint between the high Silhouette score and the Callinski-Hara.
* Silhouette is a measure of how similar clusters are and Callinski-Hara is measure of how compact they are.
* This selection maximizes similarity while making sure there are as few outliers in the clusters as possible.

RECOMMENDATION USAGE
====================

* As a standalone program:
```sh
# get recommendations for a movie with specified MOVIE_TITLE
python3 recommend.py MOVIE_TITLE

# get recommendations for a randomly-selected movie
python3 recommend.py
```

* Or within a client program:
```python
import recommend
MOVIE_TITLE = 'Shanghai Noon'
res = recommend.recommend(MOVIE_TITLE)
print(res)
```

* Recommendations are returned as a JSON object in the following format:
```python
{
	'movie_queried': string,
	'cluster_number': integer,
	'num_movies': integer,
	'cluster_movies': [
		{
			'title': string,
			'id': string
		},
		{
			'title': string,
			'id': string
		},
		...
	]
}
```

* Example error response for a non-existent movie:
```python
{
	'Unknown movie': 'non-existent movie'
}
```
